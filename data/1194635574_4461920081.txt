Addendum by [PERSONALNAME] MD, ANKUR A on March 15, 2020 1:25 PM:   ******************************  ATTENDING NOTE:  Attending Attestation: I independently evaluated this patient along with the resident physician. I agree with the H and P except as it differs from below. Please see the resident's note for further particulars. I have reviewed the nursing documentation and agree with its general content.     HISTORY: 33-year-old female with 3 days of cough, rhinorrhea, headaches, fever, myalgias.  Does have nausea and decreased p.o. intake.  No diarrhea.  No rash.  No UTI symptoms.  Recently in the hospital and diagnosed with trichomonas but was unable to take medication for such.  However denies abdominal pain or continued discharge.  Immunized against influenza.  No travel or sick contacts.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vitals reviewed and noted to be febrile. Gen: [ADDRESS] but not toxic appearing. HEENT: NCAT, no hemotypanum.  Throat clear.  PERRL, EOMI. Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy. Back: No CVA tenderness. Card: Tachycardic without MRG. Resp: CTA B no WCD. Abd: soft, NT, ND, normal BS. Neuro: 5/5 strength and sensation throughout. GCS 15. Msk: Compartments soft    ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 33-year-old female with URI symptoms consistent with influenza.  [PERSONALNAME] screen for such.  If this is negative, will have to consider novel coronavirus although less likely based on clinical history.  Other possibilities could include bronchitis versus pneumonia.  I do not believe this is related to her previous vaginal discharge as her abdominal examination is benign and her symptoms have essentially cleared up.  We will treat her with metronidazole, however she was unable to takes it previously.  She denies using alcohol and I do not think this is a reaction to metronidazole.  Screen with pregnancy test.  Check chest x-ray.    ""ED COURSE: Evaluated by myself and the resident.  Kept on respiratory precautions throughout.  Hydrated.  Pregnancy test negative.  Rapid influenza positive for influenza A.  Chest x-ray negative for pneumonia.  Treated with acetaminophen, metronidazole, oral fluids and felt much better.  Instructed in social distancing for the next week.  Push fluids.  Follow-up with PCP if not improved.    The patient's questions were answered and is stable for discharge. Instructed to return to the ED with new complaints. [PERSONALNAME] follow up with outpatient physician.    DISPOSITION: Discharged to home in improved condition.    DIAGNOSIS: Influenza A  ******************************       Perform - Completed by  G (on 03/12/2020 18:48)   Modify - Completed by  G (on 03/12/2020 18:49)   Modify - Completed by  G (on 03/12/2020 18:51)   Modify - Completed by  G (on 03/12/2020 18:53)   Modify - Completed by  G (on 03/12/2020 19:58)   Modify - Completed by  G (on 03/12/2020 19:58)   Modify - Completed by  G (on 03/12/2020 19:59)   Modify - Completed by  G (on 03/12/2020 19:59)   Modify - Completed by  G (on [ADDRESS]:[ADDRESS])   [ADDRESS] - Completed by  G (on 03/12/2020 20:18)   VERIFY - Completed by  G (on [ADDRESS]:[ADDRESS])   [ADDRESS] - Completed by [PERSONALNAME] MD, ANKUR A (on 03/15/2020 13:25)   Modify - Completed by [PERSONALNAME] MD, ANKUR A (on 03/15/2020 13:25)"
