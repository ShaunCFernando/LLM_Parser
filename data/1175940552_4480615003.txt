DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:         Labs Collected in the ED:  None ordered      Medications Given in the ED:   Tylenol 650mg once       EKG Reports     Per my interpretation: Normal sinus rhythm with right bundle  Electrocardiogram (ECG)  RATE: 89 bpm  RHYTHM: Normal sinus  AXIS: Left axis deviation  INTERVALS: PR 148, QRS 96, QTc 459  ST-T WAVE CHANGES: No ST changes or T wave inversions concerning for ischemia  ABNORMALITIES/COMPARISON: Incomplete right bundle branch block, unchanged from prior on 12/16/2019    Radiology Reports   2-view CXR: The lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.   The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.    ED COURSE and MDM:   Patient presented with history and exam as above with chief complaint of cough.  In my differential diagnosis, I have considered ACS/MI, pneumothorax, pneumonia, bronchitis, upper respiratory infection, pulmonary embolism, asthma/COPD exacerbation, heart failure. Patient's presentation is not consistent with heart failure, there was no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion on chest x-ray, and the patient does not appear to be fluid overloaded on examination. I do not suspect pulmonary embolism given that the presentation of the patient is not consistent for this, and patient does not have significant chest discomfort to suggest this. I do not suspect ACS/MI given that EKG was unremarkable, and I did not feel compelled to get a troponin for this patient. Chest x-ray was negative for ""evidence of pneumothorax, or pneumonia.  Influenza PCR was positive.  Overall, I believe this patient most likely has influenza. The patient's chest discomfort seems consistent with muscle strain/abdominal wall pain given her frequent coughing.  Low concern for ACS/PE as the patient has reassuring vital signs and EKG showed no evidence of ischemia.  Patient was treated with Tylenol and Tessalon Perles, with 1 DuoNeb breathing treatment in the ED.  These treatments improved her symptoms.  The patient was given 1 dose of Tamiflu in the ED.  She was discharged home with a 4-day course of Tamiflu 75 mg twice daily.  Anticipatory guidance and reasons to return to the ED were discussed with the patient and her friend.  They both expressed understanding and all questions were answered.  Patient was told to follow up with PCP in 1 to 2 weeks and to return to the ED if she does not improve. Patient demonstrated understanding of this plan and was in agreement. Patient was discharged to home in stable condition.
