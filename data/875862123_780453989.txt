"ED Evaluation - PUH:     University of Pittsburgh Medical Center      Patient:   [PERSONALNAME] A            MRN: [ALPHANUMERICID]            FIN: [ALPHANUMERICID]               Age:   39 years     Sex:  Female     DOB:  6/3/1977   Associated Diagnoses:   None   Author:   [PERSONALNAME]      Visit Information   Visit Information:  Patient seen on 12/25/2016.    ATTENDING ATTESTATION:  I have personally conducted the history and physical exam on this patient. I have also reviewed and discussed the case with the resident/APP and I agree with the assessment, plan and documentation. I have also reviewed the nursing notes and agree with their findings unless otherwise noted.    Patient is a 39-year-old woman with history of Chiari malformation, pseudotumor cerebri presenting with acute onset shortness of breath. Patient states that she's been coughing and feeling unwell for the last 24 hours. She states that her son has similar symptoms. Today she had acute onset shortness of breath with wheeze. Symptoms been progressive, not improved by breathing treatment given en route. She states that she also feels tightness in her throat. No ingestion. No known allergies. She does report a cough. She reports right lower chest pain, worsened with cough. [PERSONALNAME].    Of note, patient was seen last year for similar complaints. At that time she was treated with bronchodilators, steroids, azithromycin. She had a CTA that time that was negative. She was admitted to the hospital for further monitoring after improvement with breathing treatments. She subsequently had pulmonary function testing which was reassuring and showed no changes with bronchodilators.    Agree with the past medical history, social history and review of systems as documented by the resident physician unless otherwise noted.    Patient is awake, alert in mild to moderate distress. She has moist mucous membranes. Trachea is midline. She has a faint end expiratory wheeze. She ""is actively coughing, holding her right chest wall. She is tachycardic with a regular rhythm. Her abdomen is soft, obese, nontender without rebound or guarding. She has no peripheral edema. She has full range of motion of all 4 extremity's. She has normal strength and sensation.    Patient is a 39-year-old female presenting with acute onset shortness of breath. Concern for reactive airway disease given female wheeze; however reassuring PFTs one year ago makes this less likely. Cough makes infectious etiology possible; however absence of fever, presence of congestion and sore throat make bacterial etiology unlikely. Possibly tracheitis. Upon arrival patient stated that she felt her throat closing in the setting of wheeze, she was therefore given 0.3 mg of 1:1000 epinephrine IM for empiric treatment. She was also given multiple breathing treatments, Solu-Medrol as well as ketorolac given significant right lower chest wall pain with cough. Due to concern for laryngospasm, she was given low-dose benzodiazepine. Patient states after all these interventions she feels mildly improved. We will continue to monitor for improvement in her symptoms and obtain diagnostic imaging including chest x-ray, CT PE. If all is reassuring, patient without symptoms despite monitoring, will consider discharge; however if no resolution, will admit for further monitoring.     CT PE demonstrates no focal consolidation or blood clot. Given patient's persistent cough, will give nebulized lidocaine. Given significance of her distress upon arrival to the emergency department, will admit for further monitoring and workup.    An EKG was obtained given the patient's shortness of breath. Demonstrates a sinus rhythm at a rate of 115 with a normal PR interval of 148, QRS of 80 and normal QTC of 442. There is baseline artifact in the limb leads limiting interpretation; however does not appear to be any obvious ""ischemic change. EKG is consistent with sinus tachycardia.
