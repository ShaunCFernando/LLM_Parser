Overall my concern is that the patient has viral gastroenteritis I suspect she developed after visiting her primary care provider yesterday.    At the present I don't feel we need to work the patient up for anything for the hypoxia since she is on her baseline 2 L and I believe she is a self-limited gastroenteritis for which a treatment management with labs    For treatment we are providing the patient's albuterol and Zofran along with 1 L of lactated Ringer's we cannot give any other antiemetics since the patient has allergies such as anaphylaxis    ""Disposition ideally the patient will improve with antiemetics fluids and a breathing treatment able to tolerate oral intake and discharge back to home. I signed the patient out to a fellow resident who will check back in on the patient later this evening to help determine disposition.       Impression and Plan   Diagnosis:  Viral gastroenteritis.
