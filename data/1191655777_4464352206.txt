"ED Evaluation - PUH:     University of Pittsburgh Medical Center      Patient:   [PERSONALNAME] A            MRN: [ALPHANUMERICID]            FIN: [ALPHANUMERICID]               Age:   36 years     Sex:  Female     DOB:  9/8/1983   Associated Diagnoses:   None   Author:   [PERSONALNAME] MD,     Visit Information   Visit Information:  Patient seen on 3/5/2020.       Findings   *******************************************************  ATTENDING NOTE:     ATTENDING ATTESTATION: I performed a history and physical examination of the patient with the resident.  I reviewed the resident's note and agree with the documented findings and plan of care unless otherwise noted. I reviewed the nursing documentation and agree with its general content.    CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath     HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 36-year-old female, well-known to the emergency department, worsening shortness of breath.  Has had cough and shortness of breath for 3 weeks.  Recently seen by her pulmonologist but since then has worsened requiring albuterol every 2 hours but still has severe shortness of breath.  Also has chest tightness.  She feels that this is atypical for her asthma and came to the ED.  Has multiple previous visits for such and negative work-up including negative ischemic work-up.  Most recent CT scan to rule out PE was 2 months ago but was not an adequate study.     REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: All systems listed below were reviewed and are negative unless otherwise noted in the report:  General no fevers  EYES  ENT  Cardiac pleuritic chest pain  Respiratory see above  Gastrointestinal  Genitourinary  Musculoskeletal  Dermatologic  Neurological  Hematology/Lymph no history of thromboembolic disease    PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Per resident's note     MEDICATIONS: Per resident's note     ALLERGIES: Per resident's note     SOCIAL HISTORY: Per resident's note     PHYSICAL EXAM:    VITAL SIGNS: Reviewed on nurses notes  ""GENERAL:  Alert and oriented, in mild respiratory distress but speaking in full sentences  HEENT: PEERL, EOMI. MM slightly dry. TM's and throat are clear.  Neck: Supple, non-tender.  No stridor or lymphadenopathy  Cardiac: Tachycardic, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Normal peripheral pulses.  Respiratory: Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, crackles, or deficits.  Abdomen: Soft, NT, ND, normal bowel sounds.  Musculoskeletal: No tenderness or deformities.  Skin: No petechiae or purpura.  Neurologic: GCS 15. Normal strength and gait.     MEDICAL DECISION MAKING: 36-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Differential includes asthma exacerbation, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, doubt ACS.  Doubt arrhythmia.  Definitely has an anxiety/PTSD/depression component.  Stating this, will require medical evaluation as above.  Has had previous positive D-dimers with negative pulmonary embolism.  Check d-dimer and if positive, empiric heparinization prior to CT scan due to the patient's dye allergy.  Screen with 1 troponin although not highly likely for ACS.  Standard labs.  Treat with albuterol, Atrovent, IV steroids, IV magnesium.  Hydrate.     HOSPITAL COURSE: Evaluated myself and the resident.  Placed on cardiac monitor and pulse ox.  Multiple dose of albuterol, Atrovent, IV steroids and magnesium.    Electrocardiogram (ECG)  ECG from time 19:57, per my interpretation:  RATE: 117  RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia  AXIS: Normal axis  INTERVALS: Normal intervals  ST-T WAVE CHANGES: None  ABNORMALITIES/COMPARISON: Compared with previous ECG from 1/10/20 and unchanged other than rate.  No evidence of acute ischemia or malignant arrhythmia    1 view chest x-ray demonstrates unchanged heart size, normal mediastinum, no infiltrate or pneumothorax.  Compared to x-ray of 2 days ago and unchanged.    Labs: Venous blood gas benign.  Negative troponin and d-dimer.  CBC and chemistries benign.    ""With negative d-dimer, I do not think a repeat CT angiography would be beneficial.  She will be admitted to the medical service for treatment of asthma exacerbation.    DIAGNOSIS: Exacerbation of asthma    DISPOSITION: Patient is admitted to a monitored bed in stable condition.  Observation status.  Admitting team contacted, accept patient, and given report.
