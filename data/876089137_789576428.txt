On my examination, she is in no acute distress, initial ""hemodynamics are notable for mild hypotension, which appears to be the patient's baseline per my review of records. This is improved with IV fluid hydration. Neurologic examination is notable for decreased sensation to light touch in the left side of the arm and leg, without the presence of other neurological signs or symptoms. This may represent a stroke, however, given the patient's low symptom burden, and her multiple comorbidities including her coagulopathy including thrombocytopenia, and chronically elevated INR, I do not believe that she would be a candidate for tissue plasminogen activator. We did obtain a CT of the brain without contrast to rule out intracranial hemorrhage, this is negative. Also obtain CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast given her abdominal pain and her significant comorbidities, and this demonstrate multiple findings including cirrhotic liver appearance with a 5 mm obstructive CBD calculus with dilated biliary ducts, there is also acute nonspecific right colitis, which may be infective/inflammatory. There is also a nonobstructive left millimeter renal pelvis calculus within the malrotated left pelvic kidney. There is the suggestion of a 5 mm obstructive calculus in the distal left ureter with left hydronephrosis and possible left pyelitis, with recommendation made for an ultrasound of the bladder and right upper quadrant ultrasound for further evaluation of the ureteric system as well as the biliary system.    Laboratory studies reveal no significant leukocytosis, chronic anemia with hemoglobin of 7.8, chronic coagulopathy with an INR 3.1. Troponin is negative with a value of 0.04, there is mild elevation in the bilirubin with a value of 6.2, compatible with previous values, AST is mildly elevated, ALT is normal, alkaline phosphatase is normal.  Left wrist is otherwise demonstrate mild hypokalemia, mild acidosis with bicarbonate of ""20, and normal renal function. In the setting of her stable liver function tests from the etiology of the finding of a CBD stone with dilated bile ducts is unclear, I do not believe that her clinical picture truly represents cholangitis. Additionally, with regard to possible obstructive renal calculus of the distal left ureter, with left hydronephrosis, and possible left pyelitis, this pyelitis as been noted on multiple previous CT scans, and appears to be associated with the 11 mm left renal pelvis calculus. We will obtain urinalysis to rule out infection.    My review of today chest x-ray demonstrates no definite acute cardiopulmonary process. However, there are 2 previous chest x-rays, which demonstrated probable pneumonia. At this point, I believe this is certainly a potential etiology for the patient's ongoing symptoms. I do believe that she will warrant IV antibiotics for treatment of this, including broad-spectrum coverage given her multiple recent hospitalizations. For this reason, she'll be given IV vancomycin and Zosyn. She'll be admitted to the medicine service for further inpatient treatment and evaluation.    1. Pneumonia  2.
