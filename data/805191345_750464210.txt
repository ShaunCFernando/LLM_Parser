Representative imaging was obtained and saved.    Exam Type: Ultrasound of the Pregnant Uterus, Limited Study: [Transabdominal.]  Indications: [Lower abdominal pain] and positive beta-HCG.  Findings: [Normal IUP within the uterus. FHR 146]  Impression: [Intrauterine pregnancy confirmed.]       HOSPITAL COURSE:   Patient is a 25-year-old female who is 25 weeks pregnant and presents to the ED for reevaluation of flulike symptoms.  She notes persistent pleuritic symptoms after being diagnosed clinically with the flu earlier this week by myself.  A rapid flu test was sent and was positive.  She's been maintained on Tamiflu as well as Reglan which she's been taking.  She does note that she feels is her generalized weakness and nausea have improved but she has worsening cough and sometimes associated shortness of breath.  She has a history of asthma and she used her albuterol nebulizer at home and did improve however given the symptoms she called her doctor and was told to come to the ED for evaluation.  Here she is very well appearing with stable vital signs.  She is in no respiratory distress.  She she does endorse intermittent abdominal pain which starts from her belly button and from her bilateral sides and radiates towards the vagina.  It comes and goes and is sharp.  It lasts for several seconds to a minute.  She denies any trauma, vaginal bleeding or discharge.  She was concerned that the baby is not moving as much of it is moving today.  ""Given her presentation I did obtain laboratory studies with a CBC, BMP, LFTs, urinalysis as above.  These demonstrate no significant findings.  Her white count is 10.2 without leukocytosis.  LFTs, lipase are unremarkable.  Urinalysis demonstrated some findings of ketones but otherwise no evidence of urinary tract infection.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation and she saturating well on room air.  Do not suspect pneumonia note that a chest x-ray is warranted at this time.  By that most of his symptoms are due to her known influenza with history of asthma.  She was given albuterol neb as well as Tylenol and IV fluids and on reevaluation she was improved.  Her abdomen is soft and she has no right lower quadrant tenderness and I do not suspect appendicitis or acute cholecystitis.  She does not appear to be in preterm labor.  The bedside ultrasound was performed by myself which demonstrated a normal intrauterine pregnancy with positive motion as well as a normal fetal heart rate of 146.  Given her presentation I did discuss the case with Dr. [PERSONALNAME] and he recommended having the patient come to the triage for evaluation and a nonstress test.  The patient and her mom was agreeable with this plan.  I did express some concern about possibly wanting to stay overnight which I relayed to Dr. [PERSONALNAME] and he noted that he would evaluate the patient in the triage area and to be in the side of this is indicated after he evaluates her.  The family was made of this information and the patient was sent from the ED to triage in stable condition.
