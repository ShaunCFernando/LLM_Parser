Differential diagnosis considered includes BV, yeast vaginitis, trichomoniasis, GC/Chlamydia, HSV, PID, acute cervicitis, TOA, ovarian torsion, UTI, retained foreign body, or physiologic discharge.  All labs and diagnostic studies were reviewed as reported above and felt to be within normal limits.  Clinical history, examination and work-up suggest likely diagnosis of trichomonas vaginalis.  I had intended to treat the patient for chlamydia and gonorrhea as well, but because she has a severe allergy to penicillin she is only given Flagyl and azithromycin here in the emergency room.  If the patient's gonorrhea tests returns positive later, she may need to return for further treatment.    The patient appears well on exam and is in stable condition without signs ""or symptoms of severe systemic infection or PID.  Vaginal and cervical mucosa demonstrated inflammation with minimal bleeding.  Vital signs with within normal limits.  Urine hcg was reviewed and negative.  The patient is reliable and stable for outpatient management. Patient was provided general information and counseled about this infection.  She was informed that this is a sexually transmitted infection and was encouraged to have her partner(s) notified and treated.  Use of barrier contraceptives was advised to prevent transmission of the infection.  She is instructed to follow-up with her own gynecologist if her symptoms do not improve in 7-10 days.  Alternatively, the patient can follow-up at the Magee clinic if she does not have an established gynecologist. Patient should return to the emergency room for high fevers, intractable pain, heavy vaginal bleeding, or failure of improvement. Plan of care was discussed and reviewed with the patient prior to discharge.  Patient understood the diagnosis, treatment, and plan and had no further questions.      Impression and Plan   Diagnosis:  STI - trichomonas infection.    Plan:  Discharge.    Discharge Status:  Stable at discharge.
