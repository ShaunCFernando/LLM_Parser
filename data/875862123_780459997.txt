Findings   CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath     HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of IIH s/p chiari decompression, L occipital neuralgia and trigeminal neuralgia, history of dural venous sinus thrombosis and acute evidence of shortness of breath due to unexplained etiology presents with shortness of breath. Yesterday evening, the patient reports the development of a nonproductive cough with some associated shortness of breath. Throat the day today the symptoms progressed to the point where this evening developed severe shortness of breath with associated wheezing. She received a breathing treatment en route without any improvement in her symptoms. Upon arrival, she was in significant respiratory distress and endorsed significant right-sided chest discomfort that worsens with every breath. She denies any anaphylactic allergies or any ingestions this evening. Unable to get more history due to acute shortness of breath.    She was evaluated here for a similar presentation in August of last year. She was initially treated with nebulizers, prednisone and azithromycin for COPD exacerbation though this did not improve her symptoms. CTA at that visit showed no evidence of PE and she had negative lower extremity Dopplers and V/Q scan. TTE showed normal EF. And [ADDRESS] of the chest showed normal lung parenchyma. PFTs showed mild restrictive disease likely secondary to body habitus. Pulmonary medicine was consult and persistent wheezing and subjective shortness of breath and she was diagnosed with viral bronchitis.

No central or proximal segmental pulmonary embolus. However, this   examination is not diagnostic for the detection of small and   medium-sized pulmonary emboli.  2.  Scattered groundglass opacities in the lung bases may be from   minimal airspace disease. This can be correlated clinically for an   infectious process.  3.  Some of these groundglass opacities have a nodular configuration   with the largest measuring 9 mm. A follow-up CT is recommended in 3-6   months to assess for change.    ""EKG: Sinus tachycardia without evidence of ischemia    ED COURSE:  Given 0.3 mg epinephrine  Given DuoNeb treatment  Given albuterol nebulizer treatment  125 mg Solu-Medrol  Given lorazepam  Given Toradol      MEDICAL DECISION MAKING: The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of IIH s/p chiari decompression, L occipital neuralgia and trigeminal neuralgia, history of dural venous sinus thrombosis and acute evidence of shortness of breath due to unexplained etiology presents with significant shortness of breath and right-sided pleuritic chest pain. Upon initial evaluation the patient was quite tachypneic with significant increased work of breathing. Physical exam revealed clear lungs with forceful expiratory stridor. Initially, she expressed the feeling of her throat tightening. She was given 0.3 mg of epinephrine without significant improvement in her symptoms. Differential includes pneumonia, pneumothorax, laryngospasm, anxiety, vocal cord dysfunction, COPD exacerbation, CHF, PE, anaphylaxis, ACS. EKG shows no evidence of ischemia and initial troponin negative, thus I doubt acute ACS. The patient has no history of COPD and lung exam and chest x-ray are not consistent with this diagnosis. Chest x-ray shows no evidence of focal consolidation or pneumothorax. No evidence of fluid overload on chest x-ray or on examination patient has no history of CHF. The patient has no known allergens and did not improve significant relief following epinephrine administration, thus I doubt anaphylaxis as the cause of her symptoms. CT shows no evidence of PE. No evidence of acute pathology to explain her symptoms on CT. Following Toradol, 2 doses of lorazepam, Solu-Medrol, multiple nebulizer treatments, epinephrine and nebulized lidocaine the patient eventually had significant improvement in her symptoms. Toradol is given for pain control. Nebulized lidocaine was given due to persistent ""cough. VBG showed a low CO2 consistent with hyperventilation. Her main labs unremarkable.    The patient most likely has some degree of underlying bronchitis with upper airway inflammation which may have induced laryngospasm or vocal cord dysfunction or significant anxiety. The patient had an expiratory stridor without inspiratory stridor on physical exam which is not consistent with upper airway narrowing. I have a lower suspicion for tracheitis or epiglottitis given afebrile and nontoxic-appearing. No evidence of airway narrowing on chest x-ray. She has had extensive evaluation for similar presentation last year with negative TTE, V/Q scan, CT scan and PFTs.    After the above interventions, she had significant improvement in her symptoms and was able to rest comfortably with a normal respiratory rate and improved tachycardia. Recent tachycardia likely due to epinephrine and multiple albuterol nebulizer treatments. The patient will be admitted to a medicine stepdown unit.        DIAGNOSES:  1. Respiratory distress    PLAN:  Disposition: The patient was admitted for further evaluation and management      Professional Services   Credentials Title and Author     Credentials: MD.
