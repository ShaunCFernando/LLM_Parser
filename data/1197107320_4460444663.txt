Impression and Plan     Patient presentation consisting of flulike symptoms and some mild chest ""pain concerning for influenza, coronavirus, pneumonia, PE, pericarditis, pneumothorax.  Given clinical presentation, I do not believe this patient has pneumonia as he is not coughing or having any sputum production.  He is having no shortness of breath and therefore not believe he has a pneumothorax or PE.  He also has no other risk factors for PE.  I elected to not obtain a chest x-ray at this time for these reasons.  EKG is as below and therefore do not believe he has pericarditis.  Patient likely has the flu.  His throat did not have any exudates, tonsillar edema concerning for strep.  He did have some mild hyperemia of the posterior oropharynx and therefore I gave him Decadron as he was having significant throat pain.  He was also febrile on arrival to the emergency department and he got ibuprofen with symptomatic relief.  Risks and benefits of Tamiflu were discussed with the patient and I wrote him for a prescription because he opted to continue with treatment.  Patient has had no travel history and therefore does not need to be screened for coronavirus.  Patient's chest pain is likely secondary to musculoskeletal chest pain secondary to myalgias from his influenza.  Patient is given guidance on measures that may be taken at home for further management of clinical symptoms.  Patient given very strict return precautions to the emergency department and they expressed verbal understanding.  Patient also encouraged close follow-up on an as-needed basis with their primary care provider for further management of clinical condition.  Patient is stable for discharge at this time.    EKG demonstrating normal sinus with a rate of 88, normal axis, PR 192, QRS narrow, QTc 450, no ST-T abnormalities to indicate acute ischemic event.
