Report: /Users/sfern4850/Documents/Hillman_Academy_2024/PythonAutomation/upmc_clinical_er_discharge/876089137_789452978.txt
Result: The patient does not present with chest pains. According to the report, the patient's main complaint is sharp left-sided chest pain that spreads to back pain, but this is specifically mentioned as being resolved by the time of the admission to the hospital. The report notes that "My review of today chest x-ray demonstrates no definite acute cardiopulmonary process."

Report: /Users/sfern4850/Documents/Hillman_Academy_2024/PythonAutomation/upmc_clinical_er_discharge/811686335_745396708.txt
Result: Based on the report, the patient does not present with chest pains. In fact, it is mentioned in the "CHIEF COMPLAINT" section that the patient endorses a central chest tightness with sharp central chest pain worse with coughing. However, this finding is not considered significant enough to warrant further investigation or treatment for cardiac-related issues.

The patient's symptoms are primarily related to her respiratory and infectious processes, including a productive cough, fevers, myalgias, and shortness of breath. The attending physician suspects that the patient's symptoms are secondary to influenza, which is supported by the patient's laboratory results and radiological findings (normal chest x-ray and electrocardiogram).

Overall, while the patient does experience some central chest tightness and pain, it is not a primary concern or a significant finding in the context of her overall clinical presentation.

There is no mention of the patient presenting with chest pains, only right lower chest pain that worsens with cough.
